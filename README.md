# tRustyProbability

**A quick, but for myself surprisingly clean little program to answer a random question I thought up.**

Branch of tRustyProbability, but blown way over proportionate, made to calculate until the next calculation would overflow a i64 integer. Should only be run wwith a highpower machine and built as release since it makes it about 100x as efficient, but realistically it shouldn't be run, it's made to answer an "What if?" but isn't at all necessary for anything.

The question was:

*"On average how many draws do you need to make from a deck of cards to draw 4 aces, if upon drawing an ace you shuffle it back into the deck, but if you draw a card that isn't an ace you leave it out?"*
