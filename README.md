**A quick, but for myself surprisingly clean little program to answer a random question I thought up.**

The question was:

*"On average how many draws do you need to make from a deck of cards to draw 4 aces, if upon drawing an ace you shuffle it back into the deck, but if you draw a card that isn't an ace you leave it out?"*
