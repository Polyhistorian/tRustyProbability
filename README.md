# tRustyProbability

**A quick, but for myself surprisingly clean little program to answer a random question I thought up.**

There is another branch named "computerRand" which uses rusts own random functions and so can go for many more iterations since this uses up the bit quota quite quickly. Also noticeably faster since we don't have to wait for the network to give us the deck.

The question was:

*"On average how many draws do you need to make from a deck of cards to draw 4 aces, if upon drawing an ace you shuffle it back into the deck, but if you draw a card that isn't an ace you leave it out?"*
